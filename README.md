# Roadblock
MTEC-340 Final Project

## Proposal 

My game will be called "Roadblock", and it is an endless runner arcade game.

Good Outcome: The game will function as explained below. The player will be able to navigate using the left/right arrow keys, and will not fall off the road. The speed of the game gradually increases so that it becomes more difficult. The player collects gems for additional point boosts. Obstacles and powerups spawn automatically and randomly to keep gameplay varied. 

Better Outcome: The shooter powerup will only be available once the player has collected the powerup. There will be a progress bar UI that shows how much time is left until the powerup runs out. The player can choose between different maps. 

Best Outcome:
As the game progresses, an enemy AI will be introduced: it will be an obstacle that moves to block the player and can only be passed by shooting at it. 

## Game Design Primer 

Concept: The player is a block that is moving along a course and trying to go as far as possible. There are two powerups that the player can pick up. One is a "shooter" that allows the player to shoot projectiles to destroy obstacles, and the other is a "freeze" powerup that slows everything down for a fixed interval of time. 

Core Mechanics: The playable features include controlling the position of the block and shooting projectiles. The speed of the game gradually increases. 

Control Schemes: The player uses the left and right arrows to switch lanes, and the up arrow to jump over obstacles (the enemy). To shoot at obstacles, the player uses the space bar. 

Story: n/a

Art Style: The art style will be minimalist and retro.

Win/Lose Conditions: The player continues earning points as long as they are playing, and their score is saved once they collide with an object and lose the game.
